# Renewable Energy and Financial Impact
Over the past 20 years, despite the increasing use of renewable energy,
the world continues to struggle to reduce its dependence on fossil fuels.
This project analyses the data underlying the energy transition,
examining global trends with a focus on the role of sustainable policies from 2000 to today.

The aim of this project is to study global energy trends:
the process of abandoning fossil fuels, the spread of renewables, the leading countries in this transition,
the situation in less developed countries and the impact of funding for them.

**The project**
-----------------
`Data analysis was conducted using SQL on a PostgreSQL database.`

The environmental issue is very close to my heart, and I firmly believe in the importance of the energy transition.
The question I asked myself is: are we doing enough?
To answer this question, what better way to find the answer than through data?

This project was developed during my journey with [Start2Impact](https://www.start2impact.it/).

This is my first SQL work ever.
